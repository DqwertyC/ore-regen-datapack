# Ore Regen Datapack
With this datapack, ores will slowly regenerate over time, in the same locations they originally spawned in.

Configure which blocks can be regenerated by modifying 'can_regen.json'.  
Configure the y-ranges where ores are regenerated with MIN and MAX pos_y in 'load.mcfunction'

**This datapack must be added during world creation to function properly!**  
**Currently only regenerates overworld ores.**
